abstract="This chapter is an introductory tutorial on tabu search. It emphasizes the basic mechanisms of this search method and illustrates their application on two classical combinatorial problems. Some more advanced concepts, like diversification and intensification, are also introduced. The chapter ends with useful tips for designing a successful tabu search implementation.",

  abstract = {There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics (the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on many parameters). A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.},
